# Kingdoms and Castles

Created by Ethan Chan and Jacob Ogus for MS Creation Lab 2023.

Models used for 3D printing are in the `Models` folder, and everything else is scattered around.

## Software used

**Graphics**: Adobe Photoshop and Pinta

**Models**: 3D Builder, Ultimaker Cura, and Blender 2.8

## Opening files

|Filename extension|Application|
|-|-|
|`*.3mf`|Use [3D Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj3t6) to open these `3mf` files. They are models that can be exported by Cura to a `gcode`, which is directly used for printing. 3D Builder is published by Microsoft, and I created the models in Blender before loading them to 3D Builder.|
|`*.blend`|Used by Blender in creating models.|
|`*.pub`|Publisher can be used to open a `pub` file.|
|`*.docx`|Use Microsoft Word to open this filetype.|
